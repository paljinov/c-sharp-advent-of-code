--- Part Two ---

The light turns green and the door unlocks. As you collapse onto the bed in your
room, your pager goes off!

"It's an emergency!" the Elf calling you explains. "The soft serve machine in
the cafeteria on sub-basement 7 just failed and you're the only one that knows
how to fix it! We've already dispatched a reindeer to your location to pick you
up."

You hear the sound of hooves landing on your balcony.

The reindeer carefully explores the contents of your room while you figure out
how you're going to pay the 50 stars you owe the resort before you leave.
Noticing that you look concerned, the reindeer wanders over to you; you see that
it's carrying a small pouch.

"Sorry for the trouble," a note in the pouch reads. Sitting at the bottom of the
pouch is a gold coin with a little picture of a starfish on it.

Looks like you only needed 49 stars after all.

You spend all fifty stars to cover the room deposit!

As you fix the soft serve machine, Santa offers you a ride in his sleigh; maybe
the resort has a chimney you can use...
