/*
--- Part Two ---

A small glowing portal opens above the mug you prepared and just enough hot
chocolate streams in to fill it. You suspect the reindeer has never encountered
hot chocolate before, but seems to enjoy it anyway. You hope it works.

It's time to start worrying about that integer underflow in time itself you set
up a few days ago. You check the status of the device: "Insufficient chronal
energy for activation. Energy required: 50 stars."

The reindeer bumps the device with its nose.

"Energy required: 49 stars."

/*
You use all fifty stars to activate the underflow. As you begin to fall, the
little reindeer looks up at you; its nose begins to glow red.

You go back in time so far that you wrap around and end up back in your own time
again! Oddly, history books contain some new details that you don't recognize...
