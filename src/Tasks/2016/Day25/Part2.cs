/*
--- Part Two ---

The antenna is ready. Now, all you need is the fifty stars required to generate
the signal for the sleigh, but you don't have enough.

You look toward the sky in desperation... suddenly noticing that a lone star has
been installed at the top of the antenna! Only 49 more to go.

You activate all fifty stars and transmit the signal. The star atop the antenna
begins to glow.

Suddenly, you see the sleigh fly past you!

Looks like Santa was already waiting for your signal.
