/*
--- Part Two ---

Suddenly, the experimental antenna control console lights up:

Sleigh keys detected! According to the console, the keys are directly under the
submarine. You landed right on them! Using a robotic arm on the submarine, you
move the sleigh keys into the airlock.

Now, you just need to get them to Santa in time to save Christmas! You check
your clock - it is Christmas. There's no way you can get them back to the
surface in time.

Just as you start to lose hope, you notice a button on the sleigh keys: remote
start. You can start the sleigh from the bottom of the ocean! You just need some
way to boost the signal from the keys so it actually reaches the sleigh. Good
thing the submarine has that experimental antenna! You'll definitely need 50
stars to boost it that far, though.

The experimental antenna control console lights up again:

Energy source detected.
Integrating energy source from device "sleigh keys"...done.
Installing device drivers...done.
Recalibrating experimental antenna...done.
Boost strength due to matching signal phase: 1 star
Only 49 stars to go.

You use all fifty stars to boost the signal and remotely start the sleigh! Now,
you just have to find your way back to the surface...

...did you know crab submarines come with colored lights?
