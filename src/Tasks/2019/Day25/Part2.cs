/*
--- Part Two ---

As you move through the main airlock, the air inside the ship is already heating
up to reasonable levels. Santa explains that he didn't notice you coming because
he was just taking a quick nap. The ship wasn't frozen; he just had the
thermostat set to "North Pole".

You make your way over to the navigation console. It beeps. "Status: Stranded.
Please supply measurements from 49 stars to recalibrate."

"49 stars? But the Elves told me you needed fifty--"

Santa just smiles and nods his head toward the window. There, in the distance,
you can see the center of the Solar System: the Sun!

The navigation console beeps again.

You use all fifty stars to align the warp drive! Suddenly, the Sun starts

You'll be home before you know it.
